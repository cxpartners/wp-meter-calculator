# wp-micro-frontend

Embed [Create React App](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/) with a Wordpress shortcode `[wpmicrofe][/wpmicrofe]`

Create your app in `/js` - this plug in fetches all scripts in `/js/build/static/js`. When the app is built check the correct js is being enqueued.  (Further iterations might pick up all scripts in the build folder).
